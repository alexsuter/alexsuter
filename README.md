### Hi there 👋

I'm Alex and software engineer based in Zug 🇨🇭 at [Axon Ivy](https://github.com/axonivy). Together with my team I work on the [Axon Ivy Platform](https://dev.axonivy.com) 🌿 which is used to digitalize business processes in no time.

Day by day I work with different technologies and see myself as a polyglot developer but with the main focus on Java ☕. I am very interested in software architecture, DevOps, build automation and container environments 🐋 - whale whispering ;).

When I find some time, I write [blog posts](https://community.axonivy.com/t/blog) 📰 about our platform.
